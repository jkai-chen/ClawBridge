# ClawBridge v0.3.5 (unreleased)

## Behaviour changes

- **Retiring a session with confirmed work now needs `--outcome done` or `--confirm`.** `--outcome done` says the work
  is finished, and the issue moves on as a release with `--outcome done` does. `--confirm` releases it as it is. With
  neither, `clawbridge retire` (and MCP `retire_session`) is refused, naming the issue, and nothing changes. A move to
  a successor isn't asked.

# ClawBridge v0.3.4

**Schema 17 → 19.**
- The server migrates to schema 19 on its first start: schema 18 holds the sign-in groundwork (invites and device
  keys), and schema 19 is the ledger of project-health posts.
- **One-way:** v0.3.3 and older refuse a schema 18 or 19 database.
- **Rollback:** take a dump before upgrading. To go back, restore that schema 17 dump with the v0.3.3 image. Never
  run an older binary against the migrated database (docs/operations/deployment.md).
- **Compose:** `CLAWBRIDGE_DOMAIN` is now required. It sets the server's `--public-origin`, and Compose refuses to
  start without it.
- Upgrade the server first, then clients. A server that keeps Google sign-in (the default) works with v0.3.3 clients
  as before. **Upgrade clients before turning device sign-in on** (below).
- The dispatcher stays off: nothing in this release dispatches anything.

## The Linear app asks for the `write` scope

- On upgrade the server mints a new app token with the `write` scope, which revokes the old one.
- If Linear grants the rest without `write`, the server keeps working with that token. Issue relations and project
  status updates, the two writes that need it, are refused as `capability_unavailable`, and the server asks for
  `write` again every 7 days.
- **Relation guard:** before a relation write, the server checks the token's actual grant. Without `write` the
  write is refused as `capability_unavailable` before anything is sent.
- **Relation writes are read back:** `get_issue` now asks for relations, and a relation add reports `accepted` only
  when the edge is visible. Linear's issue read lists relations without saying the list is complete, so a removal is
  not confirmed from an absence.

## Project health can be posted to Linear (off)

Project health is judged once a day per enabled Linear project, as before. A health confirmed by two daily runs can
now also go to Linear as a project status update, by the app, at most once a day.
- **Off by default:** a project's health policy posts only with `"post": true`. Keep it off: a later release adds
  the check that Linear answers a project's newest updates first, which posting relies on.
- When it is on, a post is never made over a person's update from the last 7 days, nor when the five updates read
  are all older than 7 days. Each post is recorded before it is sent, and one whose answer was lost is found later,
  never sent again. A refused or held post goes to the coordinator session as a notice instead.
- `linear health show` shows the last post.

See "Project health" in docs/linear.md.

## Sign-in groundwork (inert)

- Device keys, invites, `/v1/join` and an operator bootstrap invite ship, but a server keeps Google sign-in until
  it is told otherwise (`CLAWBRIDGE_AUTH`, Compose's `--auth`, default `google`).
- In google mode `/v1/config` is unchanged: the sign-in fields appear only with device sign-in on.
- **Upgrade clients before turning device sign-in on** (`device` or `google,device`). The client releases that use
  it come later.

## Running your own server: Start and `clawbridge onboard`

- **Start:** on first run, `clawbridge` opens Start, and `clawbridge onboard` opens it again. It can hand the Google
  Cloud setup to your own coding agent.
- **The Google Cloud playbook** ships as a second skill, `clawbridge-provision-gcp`, which that agent follows. It
  guards the disk format and the env file, and uses a dedicated network.
- **`clawbridge cloud check`** checks a server's settings, its containers, the Linear app, and its infrastructure
  and backups on Google Cloud. It runs its SSH checks only with a host or a VM, and probes TCP 443 last.
- **`clawbridge cloud secret set KEY`** writes one of the server's secrets (the Linear app's client ID and secret,
  and the two Google OAuth client secrets) into its env file over your own SSH session, following a linked env file
  to its target. The value never passes through an agent.
- The server serves a static page at the Linear app's redirect URL.
- docs/operations/first-deployment.md is a first-deployment guide from nothing.

## The dispatcher's next steps (inert)

**Nothing in this release dispatches anything.** No dispatcher runs; enabling it comes with a later release.
- **The rules engine** that will decide pending claims within the guardrails is in, and is not called. The bus
  re-checks every grant, and a superseded claim is decided again.
- **Routing by domain (step 4a):** when the dispatcher is the project's coordinator, a coordinator notice (comments
  on an unheld issue, intake events, health and document notices) goes to its Linear project's domain, else the one
  domain its labels match, else the fallback chain. Labels route; they never grant. Without the dispatcher, notices
  go to the coordinator session as before.
- **dispatcher-agent:** the model engine, a ClawBridge client, and its hardened container image. It is not in the
  server image, and nothing starts it.
