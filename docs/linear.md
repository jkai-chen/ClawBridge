# Linear task boards

The L1 increment passed [independent automated acceptance](archive/reviews/LINEAR-REVIEW.md)
after the coordination increment. It is not in published v0.1.0; v0.2.0 candidate
builds remain unpublished. The [design contract](design/linear.md) and review
record distinguish synthetic, native-platform and live-provider evidence.

The [L2 extension](design/linear-migration.md) adds project sets, labels,
dependencies, parents and explicit assignment in current source. Its
[independent automated acceptance](archive/reviews/LINEAR-L2-REVIEW.md) passed;
these additions are not in the installed L1 build or a published release. Native
reads were exercised separately. Native label eligibility is a supported capability
(below), and so is a same-destination parent.

## Connect and choose a board

Cloud users need the matching service before using the Linear view or linking a
shared board: schema 3 for L1, schema 4 for L2. Personal CLI connection/profile
commands work separately.
Follow the [backup and recovery guide](operations/backup-and-recovery.md) before
upgrading a store; updating the client alone does not upgrade a hosted service.

Open the Linear view (`7`, or `clawbridge tui --screen linear`) after joining
ClawBridge, or return to it later. Connecting
Linear is optional; skipping it preserves normal messaging. Choose a personal
connection and authorize Linear in the browser. Read access is the default; enable
write access explicitly when agents should create/update issues or comment.
Sign-in times out after three minutes, so complete the browser prompt when it
opens. If it expires, start Connect again when ready; no new connection is saved.

The OAuth session selects your Linear workspace. Choose the allowed team(s), a
default team for new issues, then a Linear project (or several on L2) or
**Team board — no project**.
Preview and confirm linking the current ClawBridge project. A team such as
FJ-AgentTaskBoard is distinct from a Linear project. Projects can include several
teams; stable IDs keep the selection unambiguous.

A Linear project is optional. The curated ClawBridge tools create issues and
comments; they do not create Linear projects. If you want that extra grouping,
create it in Linear and then select it here.

The board mapping is shared by the ClawBridge project. Each teammate connects
their own Linear account and independently verifies access to the selected teams
and projects. Credentials stay in that person's native keyring. No Orca, Node or
another teammate's host is required. A provider that omits its workspace UUID is
shown honestly; ClawBridge does not invent an ID from its display name.

| Setting | Owner and location |
| --- | --- |
| Personal Linear connection | Each teammate; credentials in their native keyring |
| Allowed teams and selected project(s) | ClawBridge project owner/lead; shared authority settings |
| Issue slice, session and assignment revision | Coordinator; the Linear issue's Current agent block |

One product project can coordinate frontend/backend repositories through that
same board. Explicitly select the ClawBridge project in each checkout and qualify
issue ownership by repository/path. Separate project permissions retain separate
bindings. A running MCP process stays pinned when an agent changes directories.

For terminal setup, begin with an explicit connection:

```sh
clawbridge linear connect --name "Work" --access read
clawbridge linear profiles
clawbridge linear teams --profile PROFILE_ID --limit 50
clawbridge linear projects --profile PROFILE_ID --limit 50
clawbridge linear binding
```

Use the returned opaque profile ID and immutable team/project UUIDs. Follow a
nonempty next cursor; an empty first page does not establish that no board exists.
The following uses the saved ClawBridge route and previews a team-board mapping:

```sh
clawbridge linear link --profile PROFILE_ID \
  --team TEAM_UUID --default-team TEAM_UUID --team-board --expected-revision 0
```

Repeat that exact command with `--confirm` after reviewing it. Replace revision
0 with the current revision when changing a mapping. For a project board,
substitute `--linear-project PROJECT_UUID` for `--team-board`; repeat `--team`
for each allowed team. Only a project owner/lead can save the shared mapping.
Explicit `--workspace` and `--project` flags select a different existing
ClawBridge scope; those flags never create it.

## Work with agents

The local ClawBridge MCP adapter uses the same native connection for scoped
task-board tools. Discover its advertised schemas instead of assuming tool names.
Installing a separate official Linear MCP is optional for operations outside this
adapter. Existing host credentials are not copied into ClawBridge automatically.

```sh
clawbridge linear issues --profile PROFILE_ID --limit 50
clawbridge linear issue ISSUE_UUID --profile PROFILE_ID
clawbridge mcp install --agent codex --session engineer \
  --linear-profile PROFILE_ID --dry-run
```

Review the installation preview and repeat without `--dry-run` to save it. Use
`--agent claude-code` for Claude Code, or pass `--linear-profile PROFILE_ID`
when starting a direct `clawbridge mcp` process. The original task-board tools are
`taskboard_binding`, `taskboard_context`, `taskboard_issues`, `taskboard_issue`,
`taskboard_create`, `taskboard_update` and `taskboard_comment`. Tools pin the
process's profile/project; tool arguments cannot choose another account or board.
When checking that installation with `doctor`, pass the same `--linear-profile`
alongside its MCP agent/config/session selection so the expected routes agree.

Optional native capabilities can switch off on their own when Linear changes a
tool schema. With `--linear-profile`, `doctor` adds a `linear.capabilities` check
showing `label_eligibility_by_filter` and `parent_same_destination` as on or off,
with the reason when off (for example "list_issue_labels schema changed"); off is
a warning. `clawbridge linear status --profile ID` reports the same `capabilities`
object (or `capabilities_error` if Linear is unreachable), and
`linear context` and the `taskboard_context_v2` tool include it so agents can
see it. Reading capabilities lists the provider's tools only; it writes nothing.

A `clawbridge mcp` process keeps one native connection open for its profile, so
read tools don't reconnect and list Linear's tools on every call. Every write tool
(create, update, comment, relation changes, linking) opens a fresh connection and
tool list, so writes always negotiate against Linear's current schemas. The kept
connection is also replaced after five minutes, when the profile's access
changes, when Linear's session stops answering, and after any failed tool call,
including a `capability_unavailable` one. So a read can see a capability change
up to five minutes late; a write never does. The connection is never shared with
another process, and every call still checks the profile first. CLI commands
connect once per command as before.

Start from the assigned issue and read its scope, dependencies, acceptance criteria
and Current agent block. Resolve that immutable session through project-scoped,
paged session discovery. Ask the coordinator about ambiguous or changed ownership;
stale presence does not release a slice. Record decisions and artifact/commit
references on the issue, with routine peer conversation in ClawBridge. See the
[agent workflow](../skills/clawbridge/references/task-board.md).

Task-board inspection is read-only. Creating/updating/commenting requires explicit
write capability and an operation ID. Retry an accepted operation only with the
same ID and payload. An uncertain write is held for read-back rather than replayed
automatically. This local retry protection does not promise exactly-once writes
across machines. A peer's ready/accept message does not close an issue or confer
human approval.

Project readers can inspect tasks. Owner/lead/member writes also require personal
Linear write access and a current owned actor when one is supplied. To add that
personal capability, reconnect explicitly with `--access write`; no tool elevates
it automatically. Discover each tool's advertised input schema before a write.

## L2 project sets and issue structure

Use this section only with the matching L2 client and schema-4 service. Personal
connection commands remain separate from the authority upgrade. An older service
fails explicitly; updating a client does not update the service. L1 team-board and
single-project mappings retain their old representation. An older client cannot
represent a multi-project mapping and receives `unsupported_mapping`.

Select several projects in the TUI with Space, then Enter to preview and confirm.
For CLI setup, repeat `--linear-project`:

```sh
clawbridge linear link --profile PROFILE_ID \
  --team TEAM_UUID --default-team TEAM_UUID \
  --linear-project PROJECT_A_UUID --linear-project PROJECT_B_UUID \
  --expected-revision CURRENT_REVISION
```

Review that preview and repeat with `--confirm`. Each project must include an
allowed team, and each allowed team must be represented. Issue access requires
the verified project/team pair. A multi-project create needs its explicit
destination; a singleton can supply its sole project. Global `--project` still
selects the ClawBridge scope; `--linear-project` selects the Linear destination.

Discover scoped metadata before writing:

```sh
clawbridge linear labels --profile PROFILE_ID --team TEAM_UUID --limit 50
clawbridge linear members --profile PROFILE_ID --team TEAM_UUID --limit 50
```

`linear labels` lists the team's own labels and workspace labels available to it.
A workspace label can be applied under the same eligibility proof as a team
label; a label without that proof is refused.

Native Linear label rows carry no team or group field. Eligibility on native
Linear therefore relies on Linear's documented list filters, pinned by schema:
ClawBridge asks for one team's labels with archived items and label groups
explicitly excluded, and accepts a label only if it is in the list for the
issue's own team, is not retired (`retiredAt`) and is not archived. If the
advertised filters change in name, type, default or documented meaning, the
capability turns off and labels are refused again. Linear also rejects
applying a label group itself. Those filter-scoped rows show
`team_filter_scoped: true` and no `global` field, because a row cannot tell a
team label from a workspace label.

Native Linear issue reads return label names, not IDs, so a plain
`linear issue` shows `label_names` with `labels_known: false`. Before replacing
or clearing labels, ClawBridge proves the IDs: each name must match exactly one
label in the team's complete listing (archived labels and groups included), and
Linear's issue list filtered by that label's ID must return the issue. Only the
label ID is ever sent, never a name. Any ambiguous, missing or unconfirmed label
leaves the set unknown and the update is refused. `linear issue --resolve-labels`
(MCP `resolve_labels: true`) runs the same proof on a read so you can pass the
result as `--expect-label`; it costs one listing walk plus one check per label.

| Explicit field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--linear-project UUID` | Create destination or requested project move; update preserves the issue's team |
| Repeated `--label UUID` | Complete replacement label set, including removal of existing omitted labels |
| Update `--expect-label UUID` (repeat) or `--expect-no-labels` | Required with `--label` or `--clear-labels`: the complete label set the issue had when you last read it. A mismatch refuses the update; nothing is sent |
| `--parent UUID` | Scoped, acyclic parent in the child's own team and project; a parent in another team or project is refused |
| `--assignee UUID` | Explicit eligible team member; no agent claim or permission change |
| Update `--clear-project`, `--clear-labels`, `--clear-parent`, `--clear-assignee` | Explicit clearing; project clear is limited to team-board mode |

A parent is accepted only when it shares the child's effective team and project.
Linear can pass a parent's team and project on to a sub-issue, so this restriction
is what guarantees that setting a parent never moves the child. An owner-approved
live check confirmed that setting and clearing a same-destination parent leave the
child's team and project unchanged. The returned issue is still checked after
each change. Native Linear reports a parent by its display identifier (such as
`TEAM-4`); ClawBridge reads the parent by that identifier when it needs the UUID.

Omission preserves a field. Set and clear conflict; discover native support
before using either. Before replacing labels, read the issue and pass exactly the
labels you saw; the CLI never fills the expectation for you. If the labels have
changed by the time the update runs, it is refused before dispatch and that
`--operation-id` stays refused: re-read the issue and use a new operation ID. Unknown label ownership, membership or hierarchy context
causes an explicit refusal before dispatch. Provider automation and concurrent
changes remain separate from ClawBridge's requested fields and local retry ledger.
Project and label administration stay in Linear's UI.

One dependency edge is changed per request:

```sh
clawbridge linear relation add FROM_ISSUE_UUID TO_ISSUE_UUID \
  --type blocks --profile PROFILE_ID --operation-id DEPENDENCY_OPERATION_ID
```

Use `remove` for removal, or types `blocked-by` and `related` for their respective
directions. Both issues must be in scope. Keep the exact operation ID and payload
for an accepted retry; read back an uncertain outcome before any further action.
Issue reads list the blocking and related edges native Linear reports, naming an
endpoint by UUID or by display identifier. That list proves the edges shown exist
but not that it is complete, so `relations_known` stays false: adding an edge
already shown is recorded as `observed_unchanged`, while a removal is always sent.
The versioned MCP family exposes the same scoped operations through the existing
profile opt-in. Prefer advertised `taskboard_*_v2` tools on L2 builds; original
tools remain available for representable L1 mappings.

## Accounts and recovery

Use a separate connection profile for each Linear workspace/account. Switching a
personal profile does not change the shared board. A profile without access to
the bound team/project fails clearly. Missing credentials, expired authorization
or provider outages do not silently open a browser or substitute another account.

Logout removes the selected personal credential; unlink removes the shared board
mapping through an authorized project owner/lead. Those are separate actions.
The binding retains a revision so concurrent changes fail rather than overwriting
another administrator's selection. An outage leaves the mapping intact.

Headless users can use the explicit no-browser OAuth URL with an arranged loopback
route, or import their own token/API key through stdin. Secrets never belong in
arguments, repository configuration, issue text or agent prompts. There is no
plaintext fallback when the native secure store is unavailable.

`linear connect --no-browser` prints the authorization URL instead of opening a
browser. Complete its numeric-loopback callback on the same machine or an
explicitly arranged tunnel. `linear import --name LABEL --access read
--token-stdin` reads an existing credential from standard input. Use your secret
manager's pipe; do not paste the credential into a command or save it in a file.
Imported credentials have no invented refresh flow. `linear logout --profile ID`
removes that connection only; `linear unlink --expected-revision N` previews a
separate shared-mapping removal, saved only with `--confirm`.
